		<h1> About this website </h1>
        <p> The primary perpouse for this site is to showcase the different web languages. It is hosted on Github as part of it's Gitpages and was developed with Adobe Dreamweaver</p>
        <h2>The PHP survey</h2>
        <p> PHP embeddes into HTML without having to call an external file. This makes it very useful for sites like this that could not call an external file due the lack of support from Github. This script is an example of how PHP can communcate with a database to easily keep record from the site.
        <h3>The Javascript calculator</h3>
        <p>Javascript is supports functional programming styles so it simple to implement a computational script. It also has great control over the browser seen in the print button. Additionally, it also could could pop up an answer in a box or redirect to somewhere if it's a special value.
